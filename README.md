## A minimal chess game
This small application was designed for the final exam of the *Application of Computational Tecniques for Phyisics* course at University of Torino.
### How to play
It is a *1 vs 1* chess graphic interface. Each player makes a move by clicking fist on the target square and then on the chess piece to be moved. **Checkmate** and **check** are notified throughout the game and a **restart** button allows the players to start a new game. **_Enjoy!_**
